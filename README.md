## Description
&nbsp; Wanting to play a Pokemon adventure game but too broke to buy a DS? Thinking that the newer Pokemon games have lost their classic charm? Think Sinnoh is the best region? (The _only_ correct opinion) <br> <br>
    
&nbsp; Well, introducing Bokemon Blatinum! Team CornInCantonesePlusNuts brings the classic Pokemon Platinum game into a bootleg Pygame version. Experience choosing your very own starter Pokemon (Chimchar, Piplup, and Turtwig) and having your rival choose his Pokemon according to your choice. Roam the bushy, wild Sinnoh grass, and avoid getting glitched out of the cage of trees. Stop and admire the flowers (but not for too long, or else your rival's Pokemon will come after you). Beat your rival's Pokemon to a pulp for trying to ambush you. <br> <br>
    
&nbsp; Our world knows no bounds (except for the trees). Come join us for a world of fun and adventure!
